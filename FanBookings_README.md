## 🧠 Core Philosophy

FanBookings is **not a ticket marketplace**.  
It is a **fan-first booking knowledge graph** expressed as static pages.

LLMs are used to:
- map booking options by geography
- generate event-specific booking workflows
- translate policies and fine print
- surface scam patterns and warnings

Humans are required to:
- verify platform legitimacy
- validate ticketing policies
- keep fraud prevention current
- ensure consumer safety

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

FanBookings is built around **booking and event entities**.

### Core Entities
- Event Type (Game, Concert, Premiere)
- Ticket Platform
- Booking App / Website
- Hotel Tool
- Rental Provider
- Fan Booking Workflow
- Scam Pattern
- Evidence
- Collection

Each entity:
- has a stable schema
- has a canonical URL
- cross-links by event type, country, and fan needs
- is programmatically generatable
